# SakilaApp
An android app using the MySQL Sakila database.

Sakila database: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/sakila/en/
The database is accessed through a REST API I made, which is located on chris-corey.com.

The code is very messy. I don't really expect anyone to ever see it though.
I don't have much of a plan for this project yet. Just having fun.
